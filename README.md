# Virus's Crypto Tracker

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This simple crypto tracker will pull from an external API and display an up-to-date snapshot of the current
crypto markets.

An option has been added to push this snapshot to an external API in order to further digest the data.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Everything should run straight out of the box. I have included the .env file which holds the API key (I know...
naughty, but I wanted to ensure that this runs without any configuration)

The Beeceptor server is located at https://app.beeceptor.com/console/viruscryptoindex

### Prerequisites

Everything should run straight away if running on an Apache server.

### Installation

No installation necessary.
